## Video Captioning and Translation Feature

### Overview
Implement a feature that uses local LLMs to generate, enhance, and translate video captions. This would work alongside Whisper for initial transcription and use the rewriting modes to process captions.

### Implementation Plan

1. **Speech Recognition Integration**
   - Integrate with Whisper API for accurate initial transcription
   - Process video in 30-second chunks for manageable processing
   - Add option to use alternative speech recognition APIs

2. **Caption Buffer System**
   - Create a buffer system that pauses video when needed
   - Pre-process chunks of audio/video ahead of playback
   - Maintain at least 30 seconds of processed captions in the buffer
   - Resume playback once sufficient buffer is established

3. **Caption Processing Modes**
   - "Summarize" - condense lengthy dialogues
   - "Simplify" - make complex language more accessible
   - "Formalize" - make casual speech more formal
   - "Translate" - convert captions to different languages
   - "Fix Grammar" - correct transcription errors and grammar
   - "Creative" - add dramatic or humorous elements to captions

4. **User Interface Enhancements**
   - Add caption controls to video player interface
   - Create settings for caption style, timing, and processing preferences
   - Provide visual indicator for buffer status

5. **Synchronization System**
   - Develop timestamp matching to ensure captions align with video
   - Allow for adjustable delay/advance of captions
   - Handle varying processing times for different caption modes

6. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implement background processing while video plays
   - Add option to pre-process entire video before watching
   - Create caching system for previously processed videos

7. **Export Functionality**
   - Allow export of processed captions as SRT/VTT files
   - Enable batch processing of multiple videos
   - Support sharing captions between users

### Technical Considerations
- Balancing caption accuracy with processing speed
- Handling processing delays with longer videos
- Managing resource usage on client machines
- Ensuring proper synchronization between video and captions

### Future Enhancements
- Multi-language support for UI and captions
- Custom templates for different video types (lectures, movies, etc.)
- Voice-matching for multi-speaker videos
- Integration with popular video platforms
